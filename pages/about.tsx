            Hey Iâ€™m Bramasta, a software engineer who currently living in
            Jakarta, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©
          </h6>
          <p>
            I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.mbiz.co.id/">Mbiz</a>,
            maintaining and developing the future of procurement stuff. Before
            that, I worked at Bangun Kreatif Abadi, as a technical consultant.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Bekasi, West Java. Just side of Jakarta(the most
            crowded city in indonesiaðŸš—), and I come from a software engineering
            background in Vocational high school. I love working in the backend
            because I don't have an interest in design and am more comfortable
            creating a high-speed and reliable service rather than responsive
            design. And I spent almost 90% of my career as a backend engineerâœ¨.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare timeðŸ†“, I love being outdoors, reading a comic or book,
            and watching the movie
